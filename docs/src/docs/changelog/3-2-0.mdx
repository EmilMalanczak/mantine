## Breaking changes

- [Group](https://mantine.dev/core/group/) component was migrated to [flexbox gap](https://caniuse.com/flexbox-gap), it no longer uses hack with negative margins, thus `withGutter` prop is not longer supported.
- [Button](https://mantine.dev/core/button/) component no longer supports `link` variant due to Styles API limitations, use [Anchor](https://mantine.dev/core/anchor/) component instead.

## Other changes

- All date picking components from @mantine/dates package now support first day of week customization (either sunday or monday)
- [Tabs](https://mantine.dev/core/tabs/) component pills variant was redesigned to be more neutral
- [SegmentedControl](https://mantine.dev/core/segmented-control/) component is now a generic â€“ it accepts values as single type argument
